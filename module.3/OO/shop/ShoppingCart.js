/**
 * 
 * The constructor should initialize an empty array 
 * called this.items to hold CartItem objects.

* Add a method called addItem(item) that takes a CartItem object 
as an argument and adds it to the this.items array.

* Add a method called calculateSubtotal() 
that iterates through all items in this.items, 
calls getTotalPrice() on each, and 
returns the grand total before tax/shipping.

Add a static method to the ShoppingCart class called
 applyTax(subtotal, taxRate). 
 This method should calculate the total price including tax.
  Use a default taxRate of $0.05$ (5%).
